# This Project Is My Personal Website 
[wgermain.github.io](wgermain.github.io)

I wanted to build this website to highlight my skills as a Software Engineer.
I'll just be showcasing different programming languages that I have been introduced to.
In addition, I'll make projects with different JavaScript frameworks.
This website can potentially seen as a reference for software engineering students.

The goal is to create the the website here on Github using Github Pages, and then attaching the WilkensonGermain.com domain to my Github Pages static website.
